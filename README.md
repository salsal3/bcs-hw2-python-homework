Sorry to say that I'm still working on this assignment.
I ended up experimenting with a lot of code from inside *and* outside of the lesson plan.
As a result, it's a little messy in there. Might make you a little dizzy looking at it.
Not to worry! I'll have it spiffied up and the cleaner version shipped out tomorrow.

..later today.
